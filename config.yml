    # Note: It is not possible to use the SpacyTokenizer + SpacyFeaturizer in
    #       combination with the WhitespaceTokenizer, and as a result the
    #       PERSON extraction by Spacy is not very robust.
    #       Because of this, the nlu training data is annotated as well, and the
    #       DIETClassifier will also extract PERSON entities.
